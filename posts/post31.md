titolo: Is the Ukrainian Government Falling Apart? @VisualPolitikEN
---

- Zelensky has made significant changes to his government, replacing nine cabinet members, including key figures like the Foreign Minister and the Minister of Strategic Industries.
- The reasons for these changes are unclear, leading to speculation about potential internal crises, scandals, or a need for a fresh start after two and a half years of war.
- Some analysts suggest that these changes may be a strategic move to prepare for the upcoming U.S. presidential elections, as they could influence Ukraine's relationship with a new administration.
- The departure of the Foreign Minister, a key figure in securing Western aid, raises concerns about Ukraine's diplomatic strategy moving forward, especially with the potential for a change in U.S. leadership.
- The reshuffle is seen as a way for Zelensky to rejuvenate his government and maintain support from allies amid declining approval ratings and war fatigue among the Ukrainian public.
- Despite the changes, there is skepticism around claims of a government collapse, with many in Ukraine viewing the reshuffle as a normal political maneuver rather than a sign of instability.

In sintesi, l'autore esprime preoccupazione per la stabilit√† interna dell'Ucraina e per l'impatto delle elezioni americane sulla sua strategia geopolitica, mostrando un orientamento politico favorevole a una leadership forte e coerente in tempi di crisi.
