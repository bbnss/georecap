titolo: What Does the Future Hold for Taiwan and Semiconductors? || Peter Zeihan
---

- **Taiwan's Semiconductor Role**: Taiwan is a crucial but not the only player in the global semiconductor supply chain, which involves over 9,000 companies worldwide.
- **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**: A conflict in Taiwan could disrupt the entire semiconductor supply chain, as many components come from various countries, making Taiwan's defense less impactful on global supply.
- **Taiwan's Strategic Moves**: Taiwan is building semiconductor fabrication facilities in the U.S. to appease American interests, but they are stalling progress, indicating a strategic maneuver to maintain leverage.
- **Intel's Role**: Intel is working on new technology to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and is expected to have its facility operational in a few years, but delays are likely.
- **Japan's Involvement**: TSMC is also establishing facilities in Japan, which are progressing faster than those in the U.S., solidifying alliances that could be beneficial in a potential Taiwan conflict.

In generale, l'autore esprime preoccupazione per le vulnerabilit√† della catena di approvvigionamento globale e il potenziale conflitto con la Cina, mostrando un orientamento politico favorevole a una maggiore cooperazione tra Stati Uniti e alleati come il Giappone.
